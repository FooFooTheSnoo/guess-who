<p>     My name is Josh and I have a mechanical background. I started off in the 
    aerospace industry for 6 years and moved from there to the construction
     industry. I made the switch because I did not like the 24/7 shift and 
     I was not a fan of the long term effects of the maintenance industry 
     on the human body. When I switched over to construction equipment 
     maintenance I planned for it to be a temporary switch until I got in 
     an office. It took nearly 4 years to get a desk job, and now that I work
      in an office I’m looking to get into software for the income potential
       and unlimited creative freedom.
 </p>      
<p>     My goals coming out of this coding 
       course is going to be getting a ‘Software Engineer’ or ‘Senior 
       Software Engineer’ title. After that, I will likely know a route 
       I would potentially want to specialize in to gain in-depth industry 
       knowledge I do not have a long term personal project at this time, 
       but I’m certainly looking for one that I can create, own, and monetize 
       in the future.
